About me
======
Duanshun Li is a Ph.D Candidate in Civil Engineering at University of Alberta, supervised by Prof. Ming Lu. 
I received my MSc degree in Photogrammetry and Remonte Sensing and a Bachelor degree in Goematics Engineering both from Wuhan University.

My research include computer vision, machine learning, and their applications in the engineering fields.

I am currently reparing to graduate and actively looking for job oppurtunities in computer vision related jobs.
